# File_storage_using_Cryptography

This project is a secure web-based platform that allows users to **store, encrypt, and retrieve files** using **hybrid cryptography** â€” combining both symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption. The application ensures privacy and access control, and features an intelligent assistant for interaction.
